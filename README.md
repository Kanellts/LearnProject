# LearnProject

**An exercise for building a console application with EF Core!**

### What have I learned so far?


***In exercise 0*** (Introduction to Git, Github and Docker Compose), I learned the basics of git and github and how to set up a docker container.


***In exercise 3*** (Build a Console Application with EF Core), I learned how to set up a Concole Application and install NuGet packages, in VSCode, how to write and use LINQ queries and how to create and apply migrations with the EF Core CLI in terminal. *Very helpful resources were: [Migrations Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/) and [DbContext Lifetime, Configuration, and Initialization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/ef/core/dbcontext-configuration/)*


***In exercise 4*** (Implement a StudentsRepository and Logger), I learned what is the repository design pattern and how to implement it, how to use asynchronous programming (through async/await) and how to implement a logger for performing CRUD operations on my database. *Very helpful resources were: [Repository Design Pattern in C#](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/repository-design-pattern-csharp/), [Async and Await in C#: Complete Guide (2023)](https://www.bytehide.com/blog/async-await-csharp) and [Logging in C# and .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logging?tabs=command-line)*

***In exercise 5*** (Learn Dependency Injection and Project Structuring), I learned what is Dependency Injection (DI), Seperation of Concerns (SOC) and how to split a project into smaller ones that encapsulate different parts of the application logic, based on them, how to use good programming practices in my applications and how to apply the Microsoft build in, DI framework. *Very helpful resources were: [.NET dependency injection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection), [Tutorial: Use dependency injection in .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection-usage?source=recommendations) and [Common web application architectures](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/common-web-application-architectures)*

***In exercise 6*** (Add a Service Layer and Command-Line Parsing), I learned how to implement command line parsing to my applciation and how to configure the connection string with an appsettings.json file and the DI framework. *Very helpful resources were: [CommandLineParser Documentation](https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline) and [Mastering Command Line Parsing in .NET Core with CommandLineParser](https://medium.com/@eduardosilva_94960/mastering-command-line-parsing-in-net-core-with-commandlineparser-c20721100359)*
